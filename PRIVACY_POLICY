SnorLabs Sleep Application: Privacy policy
Welcome to the SnorLabs application privacy policy

This is an open source Android app developed by Kristian Jones. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

Explanation of permissions requested in the app
The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the AndroidManifest.xml file:

SnorLabs/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

Lines 5 to 9

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" />
<uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION" /> <!-- Required for 29+. -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION" />

Permission	Why it is required
android.permission.VIBRATE	Required to vibrate the device when alarm is ringing. Permission automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by user.
android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE	Enables the app to create foreground services that will ring the alarm and keep it snoozed. Permission automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by user.
android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM	This is required to schedule an exact alarm, and was introduced in Android 12. You, as the user, or the system, can revoke this permission at any time from Settings. Revoking this permission will, however, kill the app immediately if it was alive, and cancel all alarms set by the app.
android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION	This is required so SnorLabs can access the phones sensors to recognise when the user has fallen asleep. To reiterate, no data is collected from this app.  
If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email.

Yours sincerely,
Kris
