# What - SnorLabs
Android application that let's the user set how many hours sleep they would like to get instead of a wake up time. Using Android Sleep APK sleep confidence value, once a confidence above a limit is recorded, a countdown timer is started. If the user wakes up, the sleep confidence level drops, and the countdown timer pauses, and only restarts once the user is registered asleep

# Why
More people than ever are working from home, and our daily routines aren't the same as they were 5 years ago. When we wake up is less important than how we wake up.
